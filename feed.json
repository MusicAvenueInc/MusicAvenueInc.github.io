Founder Charis Boersma had a new baby in her life and several friends suggested attending parent and child music classes. Charis, a music teacher, loved the concept, but quickly realized that these wonderful classes were not accessible to all families. That same summer, Charis and her little one also experienced some community based family literacy programs that were free and accessible to a wide demographic. These two experiences sparked the concept of Music Avenue, a nonprofit organization focused on bringing music learning opportunities to the community in a way that would be accessible to a broad range of families.</p>\n<p class=\"\">Charis shared her vision with fellow parents, music teachers, and community members in Dane County who valued equity, education, and music. With the excitement and support of the community, Music Avenue incorporated and a board of directors was formed to start building the nonprofit organization. </p>\n<p class=\"\">Family music classes are planned to begin in the summer of 2022. Parents and caregivers will have the opportunity to bring their infants, toddlers, and young children to community spaces where they will learn together under the guidance of passionate music teachers. Music Avenue is primarily funded by grants and partnerships, and families will not be charged any fees to attend. Classes will be held in community spaces such as libraries and parks that are located in neighborhoods where families reside. </p>\n<p class=\"\">Families who wish to attend classes, prospective volunteers, and donors can find out more by <a href=\"https://musicavenueinc.github.io/musicavenue.org/contact-us.html\">contacting us</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://musicavenueinc.github.io/musicavenue.org/media/posts/5/glockenspiel3.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://musicavenueinc.github.io/musicavenue.org/media/posts/5/responsive/glockenspiel3-xs.jpg 300w ,https://musicavenueinc.github.io/musicavenue.org/media/posts/5/responsive/glockenspiel3-sm.jpg 480w ,https://musicavenueinc.github.io/musicavenue.org/media/posts/5/responsive/glockenspiel3-md.jpg 768w ,https://musicavenueinc.github.io/musicavenue.org/media/posts/5/responsive/glockenspiel3-lg.jpg 1024w\"  alt=\"Baby playing with a glockenspiel\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\"></figure>\n</div>\n</div>",
